# Villa Blanca — Food Manufacturing ERP

**Freelance Project** | May-Aug 2025 | Ongoing Maintenance

Worked as a freelance Odoo developer for Villa Blanca, a dairy products manufacturer. The project goal was to migrate their operations to a modern ERP system, integrating manufacturing and sales administration.

## Project Scope

### Discovery & Platform Selection
Conducted comprehensive discovery phase evaluating ERP solutions across open-source, licensed, and custom development options. Selected Odoo based on alignment with company needs and operational requirements.

### Custom Development

**Technologies:**
- Python (backend logic)
- JavaScript with OWL framework (UI components)
- Odoo framework
- PostgreSQL

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- Deployed Odoo instance on VPS
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Set up database backup systems
- Configured production environment

## Current Status

Ongoing maintenance contract, providing continued feature development and system support.
