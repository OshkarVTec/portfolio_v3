# Villa Blanca - Odoo Development

I worked as a freelance Odoo developer for Villa Blanca, a dairy products manufacturer from May 2025 to August 2025. Their goal was to migrate their operations into a new ERP, to be able to integrate their manufacturing and sales administration.

During the project, we conducted a discovery phase evaluating solutions, looking at open-source, licensed and in-house development for ERPs. We decided to go with Odoo because its capabilities lined up better with the company's needs. 

The project involved the development of custom modules to be able to handle catch weight operations, where the manufactured products have a variable weight, which needs to be accounted for. The development in Odoo is made through Python and JavaScript, using both Odoo and OWL frameworks.

The project concluded with the deployment of the Odoo instance in a VPS, including the development of a CI/CD pipeline and database backups.

I currently work on the maintenance of the project.
